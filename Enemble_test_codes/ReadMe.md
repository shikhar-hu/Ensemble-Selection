Datafiles: 
1. Two files from (https://github.com/shikhar-hu/Ensemble-Selection/tree/master/Datasets)
2. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/australian/australian.dat
3. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/german.data-numeric

Output : 'BSA performs better for 3 out 4 datasets with full library search. No improvement with pruned library.'
